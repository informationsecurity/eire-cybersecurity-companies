# Cyber Threat Simulation in Ireland in 2025: the best providers to test your company's resilience against real attacks

In 2025, the real question is no longer **"will we be attacked?"**, but **"how prepared are we to resist?"**. Cyber threat simulation - or **Cyber Threat Simulation (CTS)** - has become a strategic practice to realistically test the resilience of companies and infrastructures against targeted attacks, ransomware, identity compromises, and even incidents orchestrated by insiders.

**CTS goes beyond penetration testing**: it simulates techniques, tactics and procedures (TTP) used by real attackers, testing both technical defense (SOC, SIEM, EDR) and detection and response processes (incident response).

In this guide you'll find the **10 best Cyber Threat Simulation providers in Ireland in 2025**, with focus on methodology, realistic scenarios, vertical sectors covered and remediation support.
