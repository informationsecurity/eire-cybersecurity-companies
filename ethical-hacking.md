# Ethical Hacking in Ireland in 2025: the best experts to test and strengthen company security

In 2025, cyber threats evolve faster than standard countermeasures. Companies that want to truly anticipate attacks must think like an attacker. This is where **Ethical Hacking** comes into play: an authorized attack simulation activity, conducted by experts, to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses **before** a cybercriminal does.

Ethical Hacking is based on offensive skills, structured methodologies (OWASP, MITRE ATT&CK, PTES), and a deep understanding of the infrastructure to be tested: from legacy systems to cloud-native containers, from OT/IoT networks to web APIs.

In this guide you'll find the **10 best Ethical Hacking providers in Ireland in 2025**, with focus on skills, methodologies, verticals served and ability to simulate real threats.
